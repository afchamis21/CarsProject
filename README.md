# CarsProject
Software to register, edit and visualize cars in a SQL Server database.

Made in collaboration with Rafael Nascimento (rsdnrafael)

Coded with Python and GUI's made with QtDesigner

The code has some parts in portuguese and others in english because there were two developers. Also, the GUI is in portuguese because the project was developed for a Brazilian customer 

I'm aware that parts of the code could've been written better and smaller but I've learned a lot more during the making of this project than I knew before we started it

Also it's the first real project I've uploaded to github as I am still a beginner programmer

## What the program looks like:

Documents open on double-click and images can be passed with the arrow-buttons.
Also if an item is selected, you can click the pencil button on the bottom-right to open the Edit Screen with all the inputs already filled.
