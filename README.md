# CarsProject
Software to register, edit and visualize cars in a SQL Server database.

Coded with Python and GUI's made with QtDesigner

The code has some parts in portuguese and others in english because there were two developers. Also, the GUI is in portuguese because the project was developed for a Brazilian customer 

I'm aware that parts of the code could've been written better and smaller but I've learned a lot more during the making of this project than I knew before we started it
